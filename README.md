This is where I have all my insight data science files for the stayconnected-app.com.


Note to others:  This code was written late at night, and the whole project was done in approximately a week in a language that I had rarely used.  I used this project as a learning tool, so there are many steps that are likely unnecessary were used to help teach myself.  


Note to self: always push from the local host megan - then pull from AWS...never change on AWS.
